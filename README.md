The **Predicting Stock Prices Using Sentiment Analysis** project combines natural language processing and deep learning to forecast stock price movements based on public sentiment. By scraping or using existing datasets with financial news or social media sentiment, the project analyzes text data using NLP techniques and classifies sentiment as positive, neutral, or negative. This sentiment data is then combined with historical stock prices to train models—typically LSTM networks—to predict future stock prices. The project uses Python along with libraries like TensorFlow, NLTK, Scikit-learn, and Pandas. It demonstrates how investor sentiment, when quantified and modeled, can provide an additional predictive signal for financial forecasting. This approach offers insights for traders, investors, and financial analysts aiming to enhance decision-making through a fusion of sentiment and market data.
